# üèß ATM Withdrawal Simulator

A C++ console program that simulates a simple ATM withdrawal system. Users can repeatedly withdraw money from their account until they choose to exit, while the program applies transaction fees and validates balance limits.

## üìÑ Description

This program allows users to:
* Input an initial account balance
* Repeatedly withdraw money
* View transaction fees based on the amount withdrawn
* Check their remaining balance after each withdrawal
* Exit the simulator at any time by entering `0` or selecting no after a transaction

The program uses a `do...while` loop to allow multiple withdrawals, and applies different fees based on the withdrawal amount.

## üí∏ Fee Structure

| **Withdrawal Amount** | **Fee (R)** |
|-------------------|---------|
| Less than R100.00 | 2.00 |
| R100.00 to less than R200.00 | 3.00 |
| R200.00 or more | 5.00 |

## üßæ Example Output

```
Enter your current balance: R500
